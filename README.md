# Context

We got some code plus the dependencies needed for our application to run.  

Our application is actually divided into multiple chunks called **Microservices**.  

For each Microservice, we'll put our code and its dependencies inside of an isolated environment called a **container**.  

# Containers offer many advantages

- it's really easy to spin up a container
- 

# Why should we even use k8s?
