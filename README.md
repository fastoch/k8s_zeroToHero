# Context

We got some code plus the dependencies needed for our application to run.  

Our application is divided into multiple functional parts called **Microservices**.  

For each Microservice, we'll put the corresponding code and its dependencies inside of an isolated environment called a **container**.  

# Containers offer many advantages

Containers are very easy to spin up, and equally easy to replace.  

Which means we can update and scale our application in a matter of seconds.  

And containerized apps run the same regardless of the host system, which is the reason why containerization was invented...

# Why should we even use k8s?
